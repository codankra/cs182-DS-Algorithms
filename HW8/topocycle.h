 * DFS Topological Sorting facts
 * 
 * For either a digraph or even undirected graph, u is a proper ancestor of v
 * in the DFS forest iff discover[u] < discover[v] and finish[v] < finish[u].
 * 
 * A 'back edge' goes from a vertex to an ancestor of that vertex.
 * A graph is cyclic if and only if the DFS forest has a back edge.
 *
 * To topologically sort an acyclic graph, order the vertices in reverse
 * of the 'finish' order.  (Can do that during DFS by pushing finished vertices
 * into an array.  Don't do it later by later by sorting, since that costs more time (O(nlogn).)
